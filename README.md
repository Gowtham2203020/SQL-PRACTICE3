World Schema SQL Practice

Hi, I am Gowtham K. This repository contains my **SQL practice using the `world` schema in MySQL Workbench**.

I am practicing:
- Basic SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
- GROUP BY, HAVING
- JOIN
- Aggregation

These queries will help me build confidence in SQL for placements.

Why this repo?

I am pushing my learning progress here to:
  ->Stay consistent with SQL practice.  
  ->Track my learning journey.  
  ->Build a reference for quick revision before placements.

Next

I will continue to add:
- Nested queries
- Advanced joins
- Window functions
